It constantly evolves to coop with stakeholders' needs.  
As a developer, we are the creator and maintainers of the sources.

However,

It is easier to show the result of a very early stage of development than to speak on some immaterial thing.  
Developers can use prototypes and mockups to create a feedback loop with the stakeholders.
