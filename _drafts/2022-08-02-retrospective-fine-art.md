title: Retrospective - Fine Art
---

My education journey took me from place to place, where passionate and creative people have always surrounded me.

As a youngling, I ended up in Fine art.<br/>
Most of the students had some passion and were self-motivated.<br/>
We translated our idea into concrete paintings, sculptures, movies, poetry, etc.<br/>
Then we had to present our work and communicat about it.

I wasn't a natural communicator, ahah! But I aimed to improve myself!

Back then, a course called "Algorithm Practice" was an introductory course about programming.<br/>
This course was, without a doubt, where I started my journey as a developer.<br/>
It was my thing.

Fine art also forged one of my core values: Communication.
