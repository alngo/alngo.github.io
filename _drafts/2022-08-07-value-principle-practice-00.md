title: Track my task and make it accessible
---

# Principle
Track and make accessible what I'm working on with the team.

# Value
- Transparency
- Accountability
- Time

# Practice
When it is essential for the team's progress, I write down my notes on a shared repository and provide my teammate with as much information as possible.

# Rationale
- I don't want to protect myself or my position.
> My team should be able to pick it up when I'm away for any reason.

- I don't want repetition and wasting time.
> My team should be able to go further.

- I respect my teammate too much to keep everything sealed and increase risk.
> As part of a team, we should progress as one.
