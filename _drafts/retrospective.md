Looking back at my journey seems kind of erratic.

From an education perspective,
I haven't had the feeling of making a choice.

I was interested in literrature, comics and manga
Then I wanted to draw, make design but finally end-up in Fine-Art

I feel lucky and gratefull to have these previous experience, even though
I wishe I had started serious computing earlier.

Fine Art is an tremendous place, where most of the people are driven by passion.
And the student who strives in this area are more often self-motivated
with a little external incentive, maybe fame and recognition.

42 is technical but also very fun.
People here has also to be self-motivated to do better

The question:


```c
#include <unistd.h>

void	ft_putchar(char c) {
	write(1, &c, 1);
}
```
